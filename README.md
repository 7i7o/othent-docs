# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Othent

**Othent**: pronounced OH-thent is a neologism of "OAuth" and "Authenticate".

Othent is a protocol that enables access to blockchain networks using alternative methods beyond private keys, making them more widely accessible by customizing the authentication process.

The protocol currently consists of two parts:

* Smart contract wallets
* Transaction metadata proofs

We leverage existing encryption like RS-256 JsonWebTokens which are generated by the users choice of traditional log in service - such as but not limited to:

* Google
* Twitter
* Github
* Micosoft&#x20;

etc... we currently have support for 64 social connections, that's over 4B user log ins! meaning over 4 billion people now have web3 wallets with their existing credentials.
