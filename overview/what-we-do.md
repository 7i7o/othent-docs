**Existing private key wallets to onboard through social logins:**

Othent can be integrated by wallets into their app to offer social logins and alternative authentications like API keys in addition to private keys. This can make the onboarding process smoother for users and enhance their reach to Web2.

**Allow dApps to onboard through web2:**

One of the biggest barriers to entry for many people when it comes to using dApps is the complexity involved in setting up and managing a digital wallet. However, by allowing users to onboard through web2 platforms that they are already familiar with (such as social media or email), it becomes much easier for them to start using dApps without needing to worry about the technical details of setting up a wallet.

**Web2 apps as a channel to Web3 dApps and blockchains:**

By using web2 apps as a channel to connect users to web3 dApps and blockchains, we can help to bridge the gap between the two worlds and make it easier for more people to start using decentralized applications. This can also help to increase the overall adoption of blockchain technology and provide more opportunities for developers to create innovative new dApps.

**Automatable money, smart contract wallets have numerous benefits over traditional wallets:**

Smart contract wallets have several advantages over traditional wallets, including increased security, transparency, and programmability. With smart contract wallets, it's possible to automate many of the processes involved in managing and transferring funds, which can help to reduce the risk of human error and improve the overall efficiency of the system.

**Compatibility with the user, app, and blockchain:**

One of the key benefits of using a solution like Othent is that it is designed to be fully compatible with existing web2 applications and blockchain networks. This means that users can continue to use the same familiar tools and interfaces that they are used to, without needing to learn a new set of skills or technologies. Additionally, developers can easily integrate Othent into their existing applications without needing to make any major changes or modifications to their code.
